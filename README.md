ImageWebP
======================

WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy
compression for images on the web. WebP create smaller, richer images that make
the web faster.

Provided a configurable feature to enable WebP conversion for any image.
As all browsers are currently not supporting Webp format image, a care has been
taken so that the browser that wonâ€™t support will render the original image
uploaded (JPEG/PNG/GIF).
